# sudoku_solver

Hi, 

this is a simple sudoku solver in python that I made while experimenting with recursion in python and backtracking.

By implementing the 3 by 3 verification and not only the rows and columns. The solve function was called 92 times to solve the example grid instead of 112 times.

I also plan on doing a GUI version of this later.

I think the code is easily understood with the comments I provide on it but if you have any questions feel free to ask :)
