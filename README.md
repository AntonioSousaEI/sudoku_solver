# sudoku_solver

Hi, 

this is a simple sudoku solver in python that I made while experimenting with recursion in python and back tracking.

At this point it works but it can be improved. I am only checking if a number is already on that lane and column. Next, Iâ€™ll implement the check if a number is already in is 3 by 3 zone.

I opted to post this before finishing it to use this mini project as a learning tool not only for python but for GitHub as well.

I also plan on doing a GUI version of this later.

I think the code is easily understood with the comments I provide on it but if you have any questions feel free to ask :)
